# ===== Email Configuration (SMTP) =====
# Required for sending email summaries from Product Recommendations page
# 
# HOW IT WORKS:
# - SMTP_USER: Email used to LOGIN to SMTP server (authenticate)
# - FROM_EMAIL: Email that appears as SENDER in recipient's inbox
# - Recipient (TO): Automatically set to logged-in user's email from session_state
#
# IMPORTANT FOR GMAIL:
# - SMTP_USER and FROM_EMAIL MUST BE THE SAME!
# - Gmail does NOT allow sending from different email than login
# - Use App Password (16 chars) - NOT your regular Gmail password
#
# Example Flow:
# 1. User logs in as: john.doe@example.com
# 2. SMTP authenticates with: raiffaisent.ai-agent@gmail.com (SMTP_USER)
# 3. Email sent FROM: raiffaisent.ai-agent@gmail.com (FROM_EMAIL)
# 4. Email sent TO: john.doe@example.com (user's login email)

# SMTP Server hostname (REQUIRED)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com

# SMTP Server port (default: 587 for TLS)
SMTP_PORT=587

# SMTP Authentication username - YOUR sending email (the "bot" email)
# This is the email that will SEND emails to users
# For Gmail: Must match FROM_EMAIL below!
SMTP_USER=raiffaisent.ai-agent@gmail.com

# SMTP Authentication password
# For Gmail: Generate App Password at https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
#   1. Enable 2-Step Verification first
#   2. Go to App Passwords
#   3. Select "Mail" and "Other (Custom name)"
#   4. Copy the 16-character password (remove spaces)
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_16_char_app_password_here

# Use TLS/STARTTLS encryption (recommended: true)
SMTP_TLS=true

# From email address - MUST match SMTP_USER for Gmail!
# This appears as the sender in recipient's inbox
# Recipients will see: "From: raiffaisent.ai-agent@gmail.com"
FROM_EMAIL=raiffaisent.ai-agent@gmail.com
